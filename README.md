## Michael Hall 

I am a junior developer with a background in live events and customer service. I am seeking to further my career and gain more experience within the tech industry. I am excited about the prospect of working in an agile team, applying my skills and learning from others to continue to grow as a full stack developer.

I intend to apply the problem-solving skills and methods I've acquired during my time working in customer service to coding. Throughout my experience as a customer service assistant, I have enjoyed working with others and supporting those I have worked with, as well as facing the challenges of meeting customers' needs.

I recently graduated from Makers Academy, where I produced test-driven, DRY code using Ruby and the MERN stack. Currently, I am continuing to build personal projects using the MERN stack, while also studying and applying these principles.

## Skills

#### Problem solving

During my time as a customer advisor at Screwfix, problem-solving was a daily task to ensure customers' needs were met. However, we often faced system failures that hindered our ability to process sales, leaving customers unhappy and resulting in no sales for the day. With the approval of my managers, I devised a plan for our team to manually record transactions and process them once the system was back online. This approach enabled us to maintain sales and customer satisfaction during what was typically a stressful and unproductive period.


#### Project management 

I coordinated several successful projects during my tenure as a project assistant at Paolo Lucktang Consultancy. These projects included creating a product placement campaign with Schott NYC to distribute and market their winter collection through various artists and entertainers. Additionally, I designed PR campaigns with emerging artists that involved radio and magazine placements, and managed tour merchandise for a range of artists, such as Lauryn Hill for her 20th-anniversary tour.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (October 2022 to February 2023)
- I have gained knowledge of the essential concepts of software engineering, which includes OOP, TDD, and SOLID principles, alongside Agile and XP approaches.
- Worked with a diverse array of programming languages and frameworks, including Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Javascript, React, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.
- Effectively worked together with fellow learners to determine feasible minimum viable products (MVPs) and delivered them within designated timelines.
